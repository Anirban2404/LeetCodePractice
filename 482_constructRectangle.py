492. Construct the Rectangle

For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's 
size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to 
design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following 
requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given 
target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in 
sequence.

Example:
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it 
are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  
[4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W 
is 2.
